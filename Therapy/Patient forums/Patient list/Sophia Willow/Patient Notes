[head=2]Patient name: Sophie Willow[/head]

Looking to address stresses from previous workplace accidents, general stress buildup and how it's affecting them

Chose therapy looking for a way to cope (?)
"Just... How can I cope?"

Feels like they are stuck in a rut, debt, constant pain

Addiction to alcohol they are trying to kick

"It's not the security, I drank before joining and will drink after..."

"Everything hurts... Always..."
"My nerves are completely shot and damaged"
